# SpaceTourWebsite

**Multi-Page Website**
This project has a mentor, he shows the website and explains some features, its also possible to copy the code, I am trying to type the HTML structure by myself, but I`ll probably copy it after a few pages and go over it for understanding. I wont copy the CSS as I need further training on it, so will practice that part, the JS is also going to be on my own skills!

**How I plan to work on this project:**
First step is to complete the HTML files, after that I am going to add CSS (no bootstrap) to the web-page, and the third step is to add the functions with Javascript.

**How it is going:**
Day01. I added the Home page HTML I basically went over it, typed the structure and copied the text in it.
-- I just realized the project is bigger than it seems at the beggining, but Ill try my best to complete it!--

Day02. Couldn`t get to code - Had a log day at Uni and at programing school!

Day03. I watched the videos for the discovery pages, Love how the instructor explains, he really loves this project! Tryied to write the HTML at my own. Did well on the first page, but got bored... Copy+paste the pages Titan, Mars and Europe... =(
I planned to leave the other HTML writing for tomorrow, but reconsidering. trying to add HTML content today, so tomorrow I can start to work on the REAL DEAL - the CSS!
I am writing the main page structures, and the secondary pages copy+past the HTML content.
